Grab Fanart

This addon is intended a quick fix for XBMC Frodo behavior that was breaking some skins I liked to use. In Eden you could cycle through slideshows of your fanart by pointing to the Thumbnails/Video/Fanart directories. with the new image caching system in Frodo a common directory for all fanart was no longer available and this broke a lot of really cool slideshow displays. 

This script uses the XBMC Database to find the source of the fanart files and downloads them to a common directory. You can point your skin/slideshows here. To reduce bandwidth there is an option to only update new information, although full updates could be necessary if you've changed your XBMC fanart. Maybe with some digging there would be a way to make it so you only update fanart that has changed by checking some date fields or something.
